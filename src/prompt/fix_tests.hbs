Below is a piece of test code containing errors that you need to fix:

{{{excerpt}}}

Your task is to diagnose what is wrong with the code, and then fix it.
To do so, you should return **as many as the original** MoonBit test block(s), surrounded by **A SINGLE** markdown code block with language `moonbit`.

Also, please note that your output must only include the fixed test (i.e. the function starting with the `test` keyword), without any analyses or annotations.


Finally, since you will be writing **BLACK-BOX** tests, it is only possible to call **PUBLIC** APIs within your tests.
That is, you are only allowed to call functions annotated with the `pub` keyword.
Otherwise, the compiler will complain that `The value identifier ... is unbound.`

For your reference, below is the stdout when compiling this test code:

```console

```

... and here is the stderr:

```console
{{{stderr}}}
```
