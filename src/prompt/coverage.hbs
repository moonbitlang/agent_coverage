The coverage testing has discovered the following parts of the function is not covered by existing test cases.
The format of the coverage report is as follows:

```moonbit
L{line number}{coverage} {line content}
```

For example, let's assume that your would like to test the following function:

```moonbit
L1 fn abs(n : Int) -> Int {
L2   if n >= 0 {
L3     n
L4   } else {
L5{{{ uncoveredMarker }}}     -n
L6   }
L7 }
```

At the beginning of each line, `L{line number}` indicates the line number in the source code, followed by a box indicating the coverage info.

If the box looks like this `[UNCOVERED]`, it means this line is **uncovered** by any test cases, and thus you should work on writing test cases to cover this line later on.
On the other hand, if the box looks like this ``, it means this line is already covered.

In the example above, line 5 (`L5`) is not covered by any test cases, and you may cover this line by writing the following:

```moonbit
test "abs of a negative number" {
  inspect!(abs(-1), content="1")
}
```
