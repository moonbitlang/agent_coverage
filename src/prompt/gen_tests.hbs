Here is the coverage-annotated excerpt that you need to work on:

{{{excerpt}}}

Your task is to add more test code to trigger the **uncovered lines** in **this excerpt only**.
To do so, you should return **ONE TO FIVE** MoonBit test block(s) surrounded by **A SINGLE** markdown code block with language `moonbit`.

Also, please note that your output must only include the tests (i.e. the functions starting with the `test` keyword), without any analyses or annotations.
In addition, each test block should only test **only** what is presented the excerpt, **not** any other functions in the file.
Please note that each test you add **must** involve triggering at least a currently-uncovered line.

Finally, since you will be writing **BLACK-BOX** tests, it is only possible to call **PUBLIC** APIs within your tests.
That is, you are only allowed to call functions annotated with the `pub` keyword.
Otherwise, the compiler will complain that `The value identifier ... is unbound.`
